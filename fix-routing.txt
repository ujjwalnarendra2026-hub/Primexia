ROUTING FIX - Commit Message
============================

Fix: Admin page routing and middleware redirect issue

Changes:
- Modified middleware.ts to only protect API routes (/api/admin/*)
- Removed redirect from /admin page that was causing infinite loop
- AdminDashboard now loads normally and handles auth state client-side
- Users can now access /admin and see the login form
- API endpoints remain protected with server-side session validation

Issue Fixed:
- /admin was redirecting to /admin/login (which didn't exist)
- Now /admin loads with login form if not authenticated
- After login, users see the dashboard with contact submissions
- Full authentication flow works end-to-end

Test Instructions:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/admin
2. You should see a login form
3. Enter wrong password 5 times - should show attempts remaining
4. After 5th failure - should see 30-minute lockout message
5. After login - should see all contact submissions
6. Can delete submissions and logout

All API endpoints still protected via middleware on /api/admin/*
